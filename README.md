Identifying playing styles in football. 
This research project aims to identify and analyse different playstyles in football, focusing on distinguishing attacking teams from very defensive teams. The primary clients are football club executives, who can use this analysis to identify coaches that implement a desirable playing style. For instance, if a coach leaves the club, executives can utilize this analysis to find a suitable replacement with a similar approach. Using the provided football event dataset, which includes detailed information on passes, tackles, interceptions, shots, and player positioning, The data will be structured to develop metrics that capture pressing intensity, transition speeds, and defensive compactness.  The methodology involves advanced feature engineering to create these metrics and apply clustering algorithms like K-means to identify distinct playstyles. Additionally, Principal Component Analysis will be used to reduce dimensionality and highlight key patterns within the data. Teams will then be grouped based on these features, and classification models will be applied to validate our findings. Deliverables come in the form of a dashboard that include comprehensive visualization such as heatmaps and possession maps and other key statistics along with the identification of the playstyle of a team. 

**Initial feedback**

This is a well-motivated and relevant proposal. It seems to rely a lot on extracting the right hand-crafted features, so make sure you give that part the necessary attention.
